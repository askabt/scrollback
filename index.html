<h1>Why Scrollback?</h1>

<p>Scrollback enables friends, colleagues, and customers to create and sustain community in the cloud.</p>

<p>As a social text chat platform, Scrollback is <strong>stickier and more engaging</strong> than any forum system and more <strong>sustainable</strong> than commercial chat support.</p>

<p>Social text chat is <em>different</em> to IM or friends-only messaging systems, which are usually one-to-one or <strong>private</strong> to small groups.</p>

<p>Communities around opensource technologies, Kickstarter projects, or consumer brands are larger and <strong>open by default</strong>. They need different tools.</p>

<p>What about IRC? IRC is the great grand-daddy of social text chat. But it predates the Web. It predates mobile.</p>

<p>Our UX wizards reinvented the text chat experience, bringing it into the 21st Century.</p>

<p>Scrollback combines all the lessons learned from IRC with the ease-of-use of an embeddable web app and the power of a cloud service.</p>

<p>We added social and anti-abuse features to make it super engaging for users and super convenient for community managers.</p>

<p>Of course it works across platforms and across online media – we connect to mobile, to email, to Twitter, to Facebook.</p>

<h1><a name="Quick-Start-Guide">Quick Start Guide</a></h1>

<p>A Scrollback web chat is embedded in this web page. It's already live. You're in the Newbie chat by default.</p>

<p>Create a new chat by giving it a name. (If it already exists, you'll join it.)</p>

<p>Sign in with Facebook, Github, Google, or LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Invite your friends using the <strong>/summon</strong> command.</p>

<p>Click the pop-out button to give the chat its own browser window.</p>

<p>Now you can bookmark the page, share the URL, and return to that conversation.</p>

<h1>Who made it?</h1>

<p>We're a team of developers who got tired of IRC.</p>

<p>New chat systems have been appearing for the past 20 years, but none of them achieves the combination of openness and stickiness that IRC does so well.</p>

<p>Paul Graham said of Twitter: "It’s really more of a discovery than an invention; that square was always there in the periodic table of protocols, but no one had quite hit it squarely."</p>

<p>If IRC is a different square in that table, then Scrollback is in the same column, a few rows down.</p>

<p>We wrote Scrollback primarily to support communities of developers like us.</p>

<p>We expect those developers to share it with their users. The rest is history.</p>

<h1><a name="How-It-s-Different">How It's Different</a></h1>

<h2>How is it different from other chat systems?</h2>

<p><em>For a longer, more academic treatment of chat systems, see Genera of Text Chat.</em></p>

<p>Most people use text chat for <strong>private</strong>, one-on-one discussion (like SMS text messages) or for small groups of friends (Facebook Chat, WhatsApp, Campfire).</p>

<p>By contrast, Scrollback's communities are <strong>public</strong> by default. They must be, because we serve open communities. Open communities include communities of practice (CoP) and communities of interest (CoI) as well as others.</p>

<p>What's a community of practice? Developers who use Node.JS. Entrepreneurs actively working on a startup.</p>

<p>What's a community of interest? Sports fans. Harley Davidson riders. People who like cat photos.</p>

<p>We serve other kinds of communities, too – groups of friends and family, co-workers within an organization, even pairs of lovers.</p>

<p>With open chat, the first massive challenge is abuse. Spammers and griefers</p>

<p>The second challenge is establishing a vibrant sense of community. We've all seen tumbleweed chatrooms: the lights are on, but nobody's home.</p>

</table><h2>How is it different from IRC?</h2>

<p>Scrollback supports scrollback. IRC doesn't. If you're not on the channel when somebody says something, it's gone forever.</p>

<p>Scrollback is easily embeddable into web pages. Just paste a snippet of HTML and you get an interactive Scrollback window into the chatstream of your choice.</p>

<p>Scrollback has a bunch of other useful features.</p>

<h2>How is it different from other 5th generation text chat systems?</h2>

<h3>Discourse</h3>

<h3>Bitlbee</h3>

<h1>How It Works</h1>

<p>Communities manifest in public or private chatstreams, which support powerful threaded conversations.</p>

<p>Scrollback hosts thousands of technical communities. We've pre-registered a Scrollback community for every project on Github.</p>

<p>We also host thousands of nontechnical communities. Brands, sports, close-knit groups of friends and family.</p>

<p>Some communities are public. Some are private. Some are in between – what we call friends-of-friends.</p>

<h1>How to Use It</h1>

<p>There are two levels.</p>

<p>Scrollback contains thousands of <strong>Communities</strong>.</p>

<p>Each Community contains one or more <strong>Chatstreams</strong>. Think of this as a topic.</p>

<p>Every Community has a Global Chatstream which includes all the members of that community.</p>

<p>Members have <strong>Conversations</strong> within a Chatstream.</p>

<p>Members join and unjoin a Community.</p>

<p>Members join and unjoin a particular Chatstream.</p>

<h1>User Experience</h1>

<p>After you participate in a Chatstream, we'll automatically save that Conversation to your Inventory, so you can go back and review any Conversations that you participated in.</p>

<p>You can also </p>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>In the following discussion, you are Alice. You are friends with Bob, Charlie, and David.</p>

<h2>Embeddable into any Website</h2>

<p>Paste our embed string into any web page to get a Scrollback portal as a widget in your web page. Users can pop out that portal to enter the full Scrollback UI.</p>

<p>Embeds can target a community or a particular chatstream.</p>

<h2>Infinite Scrollback</h2>

<p>Every conversation's scrollback is stored forever.</p>

<h2>Smart URLs</h2>

<p>Every conversation has a URL. Inviting someone to join a thread is as easy as sharing the URL. You can bookmark useful conversations and come back to them weeks or years later.</p>

<h2>Built-In Nopaste</h2>

<p>If you paste a source code segment larger than 5 lines, we auto-collapse it, so it doesn't disrupt the rest of the chatstream. Other chatstream members can automatically expand and collapse your text.</p>

<p>Thus is Pastebin built in.</p>

<p>Your text will automatically pin to the left margin so you can discuss it without it disappearing and scrolling off to the top of the screen.</p>

<h2>Intuitive, flexible joins and leaves</h2>

<p>Suppose you're in a chatstream with Bob and Charlie. You decide that David should be involved in this conversation. You can add David. David will have access to the scrollback in the chatstream. He can read the scrollback to catch up to the context of your conversation.</p>

<p>By default, David will see the last 24 hours of scrollback. If you want him to see more scrollback, any chatstream moderator, or the person who added David, can easily tweak this: just right-click on David's name and tweak his access accordingly, to have "full scrollback". David can also request more scrollback.</p>

<p>You can configure your chatstreams to allow 24 hours or infinite scrollback by default.</p>

<h2>Automatic Geolocation Segmentation</h2>

<p>Large communities usually organize into geographic chapters. If a community becomes too large, the community manager can flip a switch and divide it by geography. Members segment into the appropriate zone, which is sized automatically by the Scrollback backend – East Coast vs West Coast, by state, by city.</p>

<h2>Multithreading support</h2>

<p>With the same group of people, at the same time, multiple conversations can overlap. We organize threads of conversation visually so you can stay clear in your mind.</p>

<h2>Smart Scrollbar</h2>

<p>Most scrollbars are linear with text. Our smart scrollbar is linear with time – it shows conversations and presence.</p>

<h2>URL Preview</h2>

<p>When somebody posts a URL, a preview of the page shows up in the right margin.</p>

<h2>Expanding Ripples</h2>

<p>If you need help, and nobody's around, your questions automatically spread to nearby chatstreams.</p>

<p>The "Cry for Help" is a text bubble that floats across a user's screen at most once a minute. Users can turn it off. It contains questions from nearby communities.</p>

<p>What is a nearby community? It is a community which belongs to the same categories as the initial community.</p>

<h2>Social Integration</h2>

<p>Our powerful social features reach beyond text chat to give you integration with Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Did somebody just say something profound? Tweet it.</p>

<p>Did somebody just join the channel? Their Facebook and LinkedIn profiles are only a click away.</p>

<h2>Multimedia Integration</h2>

<p>Scrollback does not support video or voice chat directly. Instead, it supports easy call-outs to Skype, ooVoo, and 3rd party multimedia chat providers.</p>

<h2>Continuous Partial Attention</h2>

<p>The last thing you need is another messaging medium – if it's just another source of noise and bother.</p>

<p>We know that your attention is the scarcest resource you have. We respect and conserve it in a number of ways.</p>

<h3>Etiquette</h3>

<p>The etiquette of Scrollback honors your right to go AFK: to go offline, away from the keyboard, in the real world.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Scrollback automatically accretes a summary of what happened while you were away. It emails you that summary once a day so you can catch up.</p>

<h3>Triage Pane</h3>

<p>The web interface gathers into a single view all communications directed at you. It lets you dismiss the ones that have gone stale, leaving only those that deserve a response.</p>

<h3>Priority Invocations</h3>

<p>If you're expecting an urgent communication, you can tell Scrollback to notify you by mobile or email, to summon you back to the chat.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>We're designed to be embedded. It's easy for you to re-skin Scrollback to match your existing look and feel.</p>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<h3>Primitives</h3>

<p>What is a conversation?</p>

<p>It is a combination of three primitives:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>People</p></li>
<li><p>Topic (subject matter)</p></li>
<li><p>Time period</p></li>
</ol><p>Any two of those three is sufficient to identify a conversation.</p>

<h3><a name="Genera-of-Text-Chat">Genera of Text Chat</a></h3>

<p>Our classification of text chat media prefers the term "genre" to "generation" because the affordances and modalities of chat media tend to recur across platforms and over time. Systems such as Habitat (1986) and Second Life (2003) share a thread; so do CU-SeeMe (1992) and ooVoo (2007).</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>1st Gen: one-to-one text talk</p>

<p>Text-only, generally one-to-one, private chats.</p>
</li>
</ol><pre><code>-   SMS

-   Unix talk

-   ICQ

-   AIM

-   basic Jabber and Google Talk

-   basic Facebook Messenger
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>2nd Gen: multi-user social text chat</p>

<p>Text-only, multi-user chats introduce a public/private dimension, with ACLs that include <em>invite only</em> and <em>secret</em> modes.</p>
</li>
</ol><pre><code>-   AOL Chatrooms

-   IRC

-   MUDs and MOOs

-   Facebook Chats
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>3rd Gen: multimedia integration</p>

<p>Going beyond text to voice and video chat. The public/private dimension remains, but typically retreats to small groups of friends. Appearance of visual avatars.</p>
</li>
</ol><pre><code>-   Skype

-   iChat

-   ooVoo

-   Habitat

-   Second Life

-   MMORPGS

-   Chatroulette is notable as an extreme case for its flagship, exhibitionistic fully-public connections with strangers.
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>4th Gen: mobile platforms</p>

<p>Some 3rd gen chat platforms successfully extended to mobile platforms. New mobile-first platforms arose as OTT services.</p>
</li>
</ol><pre><code>-   Skype

-   iChat

-   WhatsApp

-   Viber
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>
<p>5th Gen: multi-user social chat with multimedia integration and mobile support</p>

<p>5th Gen systems work with a broad palette of features. No longer limited by technology, 5th Gen systems differ in their choice of design tradeoffs. They differentiate along dimensions of etiquette and the aesthetics of the user experience.</p>
</li>
</ol><h3>Affordances of Text Chat</h3>

<p>The differences between text chat systems can be articulated using the following (incomplete) list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>threading</p></li>
<li><p>highlighting</p></li>
<li><p>scrollback</p></li>
<li><p>logging</p></li>
<li><p>bots</p></li>
<li><p>etiquette conventions</p></li>
<li><p>out of office autoreply</p></li>
<li><p>gateways between multiple protocols</p></li>
<li><p>presence notification</p></li>
<li><p>sync vs async</p></li>
<li><p>the idea of lag</p></li>
<li><p>the idea of netsplits</p></li>
<li><p>the idea of channels</p></li>
<li><p>the idea of editability</p></li>
<li><p>lurking (active vs peripheral participation)</p></li>
<li><p>group chat vs 1-to-1</p></li>
<li><p>different status levels (regular, chanop, oper)</p></li>
<li><p>reputation system ranking</p></li>
<li><p>degree of technical skill required to use the medium – is the primary interface Terminal or Browser?</p></li>
<li><p>maximum message length</p></li>
<li><p>which then gave rise to URL shorteners</p></li>
<li><p>support for plain text vs HTML</p></li>
<li><p>are images embeddable?</p></li>
<li><p>support for file transfers</p></li>
</ul><h3>Major Columns in the Periodic Table of Protocols</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>one-to-many push = announcement mailing lists</p></li>

<li><p>many-to-many push = discussion mailing lists</p></li>
<li><p>one-to-one realtime chat</p></li>
<li><p>one-to-one and one-to-few asynchronous email</p></li>
<li><p>near-synchronous collaborative editable content (wiki, writely, google docs)</p></li>
